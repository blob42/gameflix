A Apple TV youtube client that uses **youtube-dl** in the backend and XML templates
for the APP.

The project was a prototype waiting for an official Youtube SDK for Apple TV.
It uses **youtube-dl** to parse the direct link to the video and plays it on the 
Apple TV.

The project is now abandoned, feel free to use the code.
